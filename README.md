# TicTacToe Game in Java  

A simple console-based TicTacToe game written in **Java**. This project is an implementation of the classic two-player game, demonstrating basic Java programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and arrays.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Two-player mode: Play TicTacToe with another person.  
- Dynamic board updates after each move.  
- Checks for winning conditions and declares the winner or a draw.  
- Input validation to prevent invalid moves.  

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA

## ðŸ“˜ How It Works  
1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 board.  
2. Players take turns to place their markers (`X` or `O`) on the board.  
3. The game checks for a winner after each move.  
4. The game ends when one player wins or the board is full (draw).
